%% Activities
% Consider a two-link planar representation of the limb with one actuation 
% redundancy, i.e., n = 2 and m = 3, to work out the following points.
%   1. Consider a mechanical extension spring model of the muscle and 
%      develop expressions for the muscle space stiffness matrix. Develop 
%      the joint-space stiffness matrix and task-space stiffness matrix.
%   2. Using some numerical values for stiffness offered by each mechanical 
%      spring, compute the task space and joint space stiffness matrices 
%      when no external force is applied at the limb. I will compute task 
%      and joint space ellipses when the arm is performing a reaching task
%      and create an animation out of the movement.
